      <p>
        At the Flipkart Group, solving e-commerce for India is an objective that
        we take very seriously. At the same time, we must remind ourselves
        constantly that our work is not just about what we achieve, but how we
        achieve it. Success is only meaningful if it is achieved the right way.
        So while we continue to grow and achieve greater milestones, we are
        committed to acting with integrity and ensuring that every decision we
        make is based on ethical and moral principles. Our Code of Conduct is
        built on the theme ‘Integrity Builds Trust’ which aligns with our
        enterprise objective - of establishing ‘Trust as a Competitive
        Advantage’. Our Code clearly reflects how our commitment to integrity
        helps us build trust with our employees, customers, communities, and
        other stakeholders. At its core is a simple guideline: do the right
        thing and speak up freely whenever you have a concern or see something
        out of place. Our culture of integrity is what makes us stand out as an
        organization and defines who we are as a company. Our values are
        embedded in our vision and it helps us make a difference – to ourselves
        and to everyone we interact with. Flipkart Private Limited is an Indian
        e-commerce company, headquartered in Bengaluru, and incorporated in
        Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused on
        online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as
        consumer electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle
        products. The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic
        rival Snapdeal.[5][6] As of March 2017, Flipkart held a 39.5% market
        share in the Indian e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart has a dominant
        position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra,
        and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of
        electronics and mobile phones.[8] Start-up Phase Flipkart was founded in
        October 2007 in Mumbai by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, alumni of the
        IIT, Delhi and former Amazon employees.[9][10][11] The company initially
        focused on online book sales with country-wide shipping. Flipkart slowly
        grew in prominence and was receiving 100 orders per day by 2008.[12]
        Growth, Mergers and Acquisitions In 2010, Flipkart acquired the
        Bangalore-based social book discovery service WeRead from Lulu.com.[13]
        In 2011, Flipkart acquired the digital distribution business
        Mime360.com[14] and the digital content library of the Bollywood portal
        Chakpak.[15] Following the acquisition, Flipkart launched their DRM-free
        online music store Flyte in 2012. Due to competition from free streaming
        sites, Flyte was unsuccessful and shut down in June
        2013.[16][17][18][19] With its eyes on India's retail market, Flipkart
        acquired Letsbuy, an online electronics retailer,[20] in 2012, and
        Myntra, an online fashion retailer, for US$280 million in May 2014.[21]
        Myntra continues to operate alongside Flipkart as a standalone
        subsidiary focusing on separate market segments.[22] In April 2015,
        Flipkart acquired Appiterate, a Delhi-based mobile marketing automation
        firm. Flipkart stated that it would use Appiterate's technology to
        enhance its mobile services.[23] In December 2015, Flipkart purchased a
        minority stake in the digital mapping provider MapmyIndia[24] and the
        UPI mobile payments startup PhonePe.[25][26] In 2022, when PhonePe moved
        its entire base to India, Flipkart separated the ownership of PhonePe
        and shareholders in India and Singapore and the respective shareholders
        purchased shares of PhonePe's India entity directly. It was announced
        that a cash payout of approximately $700 Mn was to the former and
        current employees who were holding PhonePe's shares.[27][28] In 2016,
        Flipkart acquired the online fashion retailer Jabong.com from Rocket
        Internet for US$70 million and In January 2017, Flipkart made a US$2
        million investment in TinyStep, a parenting information startup.[29] In
        April 2017, eBay announced that it would sell its Indian subsidiary,
        eBay.in, to Flipkart and invest US$500 million in the company. While
        eBay suggested that the partnership would allow Flipkart to access
        eBay's network of international vendors, these plans never came to
        fruition.[30][31] In July 2017, Flipkart made an offer to acquire its
        main domestic competitor, Snapdeal, for US$700 to 800 million. It was
        rejected by Snapdeal, which was seeking at least US$1 billion.[32] In
        August 2018, American retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling
        stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion, valuing Flipkart at around US$20
        billion.[33] Flipkart is valued at $37.6 billion as of 2022.[34] It is
        planning to go public through a listing in the United States of America
        in 2023.[35] Flipkart invested US$4 million in the customer engagement
        and rewards platform EasyRewardz on 19 November 2019.[36][37] In 2020,
        Flipkart Wholesale launched a digital platform for kiranas and
        MSMEs.[38] In July 2020, Flipkart acquired a 27% stake in Arvind
        Fashions Limited's newly formed subsidiary Arvind Youth Brands for US$35
        million. Arvind Youth Brands owns the Flying Machine brand.[39] Flipkart
        also announced it will roll out Flipkart Quick, a hyperlocal 90-minute
        delivery service for product categories such as groceries, home
        accessories, mobile phones, stationery, and more.[40] In October 2020,
        Flipkart acquired a 7.8% stake in Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail for
        US$204 million.[41][42] The following month, Flipkart acquired the
        intellectual property of gaming startup Mech Mocha for an undisclosed
        amount.[43] The acquisition formed part of Flipkart's plans to gain and
        retain users by offering casual games.[44] In November 2020, Flipkart
        acquired augmented reality company Scapic, which provides a suite of
        tools to create and publish augmented reality, virtual reality, and 3D
        content quickly and without coding.[45] Gujarati language was also added
        to their platform in 2021 which resulted in Flipkart being available in
        8 local Indian languages that were Gujarati, Bengali, Odia, Hindi,
        Telugu, Kannada, Marathi and Tamil.[46] In April 2021, Flipkart
        announced the acquisition of travel booking portal
        Cleartrip.[47]Flipkart also entered the hotel industry for Indian and
        global market. The Flipkart Hotels uses Cleartrip API.[48] Flipkart
        acquired the Cleartrip's business in middle east by signing an agreement
        with Wego - an online market place for travel that operates in middle
        east and North Africa. This included sale of website Flyin.com.[49] In
        April 2022, Flipkart launched its first grocery fulfilment centre in
        Northeast India, based in Guwahati. The centre was reportedly women-run
        to support the career progression of Flipkart's female employees.[50]
        The same month, the company established the Flipkart Foundation to
        support entrepreneurship and skill development within underserved
        communities in India.[51] In 2022, Flipkart entered the Non-Fungible
        Tokens (NFTs) and Web3 segment by letting the Indian purchasers of
        Nothing Phone (1) to get Nothing's NFT through the app called Nothing
        Community Dots. These NFTs use Polygon blockchain to host it.[52] The
        NFT drop happened at FireDrops - which was done on Flipkart's NFT
        marketplace, supported by GuardianLink.[53] In October 2022, Flipkart
        also created a shopping platform that was metaverse-based, called
        Flipverse. The platform allows people to explore products and shop in a
        more interactive way.[54] The Flipverse has been created through a
        partnership with a Polygon-incubated firm called eDAO, and Flipverse
        hopes to provide a similar experience to actual mall like shopping where
        people would be able to create their own Avatars.[55] The ecommerce also
        started a virtual storefront that is dedicated to academic needs of
        students named ‘Flipkart Student’s Club’.[56] Partnerships In February
        2014, Flipkart partnered with Motorola Mobility to be the exclusive
        Indian retailer of its Moto G smartphone.[57] Motorola also partnered
        with Flipkart on the Moto E, a phone targeted primarily towards emerging
        markets such as India. High demand for the phone following its midnight
        launch on 14 May caused the Flipkart website to crash.[58] Flipkart
        subsequently held exclusive Indian launches for other smartphones,
        including the Xiaomi Mi 3 in July 2014 (whose initial release of 10,000
        devices sold out in around 5 seconds),[59] and the Redmi 1S and Redmi
        Note in late 2014.[60][61][62][63] On 6 October 2014, coinciding with
        the company's anniversary and the Diwali season,[64] Flipkart held a
        major sale that it promoted as "Big Billion Day". The event generated a
        surge of traffic, selling US$100 million worth of goods in 10 hours. The
        event received criticism via social media over technical issues
        experienced during the event and stock shortages.[65][66][67][68] In
        August 2019, Flipkart partnered with Authentic Brands to license and
        distribute Nautica in India.[69] It was reported the same month that
        Flipkart entered talks to invest around US$40 million in last-mile
        delivery startup Shadowfax, which would be the company's third
        investment in the logistics sector after backing BlackBuck and
        QikPod.[70] The deal was completed four months later as a US$60 million
        financing round.[71] It also launched a reward system called Super coins
        which allowed customers to earn points on various Flipkart brands like
        Myntra, Cleartrip and Phonepe.[72] Flipkart also partnered with
        Narayanpet District - also known by its brand name Aarunya in Telangana
        that is known for handlooms and handicrafts to build capacity of local
        women artisans and have their products available for purchase
        online.[73] Similarly, the organization also partnered with Government
        of West Bengal's Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and Textiles
        (MSME&T) Department to help local artisans, handcraft makers and weavers
        to get training and support to sell their products on the platforms via
        timebound incubation.[74] Big Billion Days In October 2015, Flipkart
        reprised the Big Billion Days event as a multi-day event exclusive to
        the Flipkart app. Flipkart bolstered its supply chain and introduced
        more fulfillment centers to meet customer demand.[75] Flipkart achieved
        a gross merchandise volume of US$300 million during the event, with the
        largest volumes coming from fashion sales and the largest value coming
        from mobiles.[76] In 2017, Flipkart sold 1.3 million phones in 20 hours
        on 21 September during its Big Billion Days promotion, doubling the
        number sold on the first day of the same event in 2016.[77] Flipkart
        held a 51% share of all Indian smartphone shipments in 2017, overtaking
        Amazon India (33%).[78] Walmart Investment On 4 May 2018, it was
        reported that Walmart had won a bidding war with Amazon to acquire a
        majority stake in Flipkart for US$15 billion.[79][80] On 9 May 2018,
        Walmart officially announced its intent to acquire a 77% controlling
        stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion.[81] Following the purchase,
        Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal left the company. The remaining
        management team reported to Marc Lore, CEO of Walmart eCommerce US.[82]
        Walmart president Doug McMillon cited plans to help Flipkart with its
        sourcing and supply chain, while tapping on its expertise to expand
        Walmart globally.[83] Indian traders protested against the deal,
        considering it a threat to domestic business.[84][85] In a filing with
        the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission on 11 May 2018, Walmart
        stated that a condition of the deal prescribed the possibility that
        Flipkart's current minority shareholders "may require Flipkart to effect
        an initial public offering following the fourth anniversary of the
        closing of the transactions at a valuation no less than that paid by
        Walmart".[86][87] Following the announcement of Walmart's deal, eBay
        announced that it would sell its stake in Flipkart back to the company
        for approximately US$1.1 billion and relaunch its own Indian operations.
        The company stated that "there is the huge growth potential for
        e-commerce in India and significant opportunity for multiple players to
        succeed in India's diverse, domestic market."[30] Softbank Group also
        sold its entire 20% stake to Walmart without disclosing terms of the
        sale.[88] Walmart's acquisition of 77% stake in Flipkart was completed
        on 18 August 2018. Walmart also provided US$2 billion in equity funding
        to the company.[89][90] On 13 November 2018, Flipkart CEO Binny Bansal
        resigned after facing an allegation of "serious personal misconduct".
        Walmart stated that "while the investigation did not find evidence to
        corroborate the complainant's assertions against Binny, it did reveal
        other lapses in judgment, particularly a lack of transparency, related
        to how Binny responded to th e situation."[91][92] Other ventures In
        July 2021, Flipkart launched its social commerce marketplace called
        Shopsy, which allowed individuals and small businesses to direct sell
        and resell products to customers via social media channels.[93] In
        December 2021, Shopsy entered the grocery delivery segment in 700 cities
        across India.[94][95] Shopsy passed more than 100 million users in the
        month of September in 2022 with more than 60% of users coming to tier 2
        and other cities.[96]
